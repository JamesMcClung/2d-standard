        The spider wraps an incapacitated creature in the spider's space in silk. The target must be the same size as the spider or smaller. The target is restrained while wrapped. The target or another creature can use a standard action and make a DC 13 Strength check to break the silk and free the target. Any slashing damage dealt to the silk also frees the target (the silk has 10 AC).

        The spider can also use this action to construct a web. Making a 5-foot diameter web takes 1 hour, using this action every turn. Noticing the web requires a DC 13 Perception check. A Tiny creature that touches the web must succeed on a @save(str, dex) or be restrained, as if by the usual use of this action. The web itself is destroyed if it takes any slashing or fire damage (it has 10 AC).
      name: Web Wrap
  alignment: unaligned
  attacks:
    - hit: 1 poison damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

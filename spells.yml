    You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as a standard action to gain the benefits of a different one.

    **Aquatic Adaptation.** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swim speed equal to your walk speed.

    **Change Appearance.** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use a standard action to change your appearance in this way again.

    **Natural Weapons.** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

    When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice.

antimagic_field:
  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V, S, M
  concentration: true
  description: |-
    A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

    Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

    **Targeted Effects.** Spells and other magical effects, such as _magic missile_ and _charm person_, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

    **Areas of Magic.** The area of another spell or magical effect, such as _fireball_, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a _wall of fire_ are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

    **Spells.** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

    **Magic Items.** The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a _+1 longsword_ in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.

    A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

    **Magical Travel.** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the _mirror mansion_ spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

    **Creatures and Objects.** A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

    **Dispel Magic.** Spells and magical effects such as _dispel magic_ have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different _antimagic field_ spells don't nullify each other.

antipathy_sympathy:
  casting_time: 1 hour
  components: V, S, M
  concentration: false
  description: |-
    This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

    **Antipathy.** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

    **Sympathy.** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

    **Ending the Effect.** If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

    A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

    You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within the spell's range. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.

    The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering in place in any orientation you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.

    Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the non-portal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can reorient the rings as a minor action so that the active side faces a different direction.

  components: V, S, M
  concentration: false
  description: |-
    You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.

    Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

    Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.

    The spell ends for you and your companions when you use a standard action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.

    The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful _dispel magic_ spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.

    If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

    You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

    If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.

    If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use a standard action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC.

This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

    Ghastly hands rise from the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range, and white mist fills the area. The mist cause the area to be lightly obscured, while the hands cause the ground to be difficult terrain.

    When you cast the spell, and at the start of each of your turns for the spell's duration, you can force each creature of your choice in the area that you can see to make a Strength saving throw.

    Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

    This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it (save ends).

    An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

    | d10  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                        |

    You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A _greater restoration_ spell cast on you ends this effect.

    On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

    Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned.

    At the end of each of the poisoned target's turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.

    Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

    **Blinding Sickness.** Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.

    **Filth Fever.** A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

    **Flesh Rot.** The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

    **Mindfire.** The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the _confusion_ spell during combat.

    **Seizure.** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

    **Slimy Doom.** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

    Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 standard action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting _contingency_, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a _contingency_ cast with _water breathing_ might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

    The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then _contingency_ ends.

    The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one _contingency_ spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another _contingency_ spell on you ends. Also, _contingency_ ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

    - You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
    - You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.
    - You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.

  concentration: true
  description: |-
    Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As a standard action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

    **Flood.** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

    **Part Water.** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

    **Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

    **Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use a standard action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

    The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

    You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

    When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

    When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.

    You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use a standard action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use a standard action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you‘ve halted.

    **Gusts.** A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that enter or leave the cube or pass through it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

    **Downdraft.** You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

    **Updraft.** You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

    You affix your soul to the token object used as this spell's material component and endow it with a source of fuel for everlasting unlife. As part of casting this spell, you or another creature must use the ritual dagger used as the spell's material component to kill one or more humanoids within 30 feet of you. The souls of the slain humanoids become bound to the token object, which becomes your phylactery at the end of the spell.

    When you die, your consciousness enters the phylactery as if the phylactery were a _magic jar_, except you have no body to return to. Every 1d100 days while you are in this state, if there are any other souls bound to the phylactery, one of them is destroyed and you form a new body within 10 feet of the phylactery. Your new body is undead, doesn't age, has immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and has resistance to necrotic damage, but otherwise uses your game statistics.

    Nothing short of divine intervention can resurrect you or a creature whose soul is bound to the phylactery. The phylactery can be destroyed, however. It is a magical object with AC 30 and immunity to all damage except force damage and the damage dealt by magical weapons. It is only destroyed if it takes at least 50 damage at once. It is unaffected by spells such as _dispel magic_ and _antimagic field_.

    If the phylactery is destroyed, you die, your soul is destroyed, and any other souls bound to it are freed. Not even divine intervention can resurrect you or another creature whose soul has been destroyed by this spell.

    You can only have one phylactery. Casting this spell again using your phylactery as the token object simply binds more souls to the phylactery.

    The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.

    A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

    If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

    When you cast the spell and as a standard action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on a particular creature that you can sense with mindsense to learn its surface thoughts (what is most on its mind at that moment). As a subsequent standard action, you can attempt to probe deeper into that creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use a standard action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

    Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

    You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use a standard action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

    A creature can also use the Study action to inspect you from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers which aspects of your appearance are illusory.

    Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

    You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.

    **Break Enchantment.** As a standard action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

    **Dismissal.** As a standard action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.

    You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature.

    When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

    **False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as _detect magic_, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.

    **Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a _symbol_ spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

    You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

    While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

    You can use a standard action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

    This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger.

    While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions.

    If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.

    You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

    If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

    You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.

    The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

    The entire warded area radiates magic. A _dispel magic_ cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.

    **Solid Fog.** You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.

    **Grasping Undergrowth.** You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an _entangle_ spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.

    **Grove Guardians.** You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can‘t leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.

    **Additional Spell Effect.** You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:

    - A constant _gust of wind_ in two locations of your choice.
    - _Spike growth_ in one location of your choice.
    - _Wind wall_ in two locations of your choice.

    To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of _spike growth_ is harmless.

    An illusory duplicate of yourself appears in an unoccupied space within range. The illusion looks, sounds, and acts just like you. You can use a free action to cause it to move up to your speed to a space you can see, but it can't talk or imitate any other actions.

    Physical interaction with the duplicate reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature can also use the Study action to inspect the duplicate from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the duplicate is illusory.

    As a minor action, if the duplicate's space is within range and unoccupied, you can switch places with the duplicate by teleporting to its space. This transposition is visually and audibly undetectable, so a creature that previously identified your duplicate as illusory may now believe that you are the fake and the duplicate is real.

    As a minor action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction.

    As a standard action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    To break out, the restrained target can use a standard action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

    As a standard action, you can cause the hand to release a restrained target (if any) and move up to 30 feet and reach for a different creature you can see, subjecting it to the spell's initial effect. The hand can move along any earth or stone surface, even walls and ceilings.

  description: |-
    You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

    The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

    When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

    This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

    **Fissures.** Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

    A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

    **Structures.** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as a standard action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

    You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

    If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

    **Enlarge.** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. While enlarged in this way, the target gains the following benefits:
    - Its reach increases by 5 feet.
    - It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
    - Its weapon attacks deal 1d4 extra damage.

    **Reduce.** The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. While reduced in this way, the target suffers the following effects:
    - Its reach decreases by 5 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet).
    - It has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
    - Its weapon attacks deal 1d4 less damage. This can't reduce an attack's damage below 1.

    You cause a fountain of lava to burst from the ground at a point you can see within range. Each creature within a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage and 3d12 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  This spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

    The ground in the spell's area becomes a lake of molten lava for the duration, which is difficult terrain. A creature that ends its turn in the lava takes 2d12 fire damage, and a creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the lava (but not in it) takes 1d12 fire damage.

    On each of your subsequent turns for the duration of the spell, you can use a standard action to cause debris to spew from the lava lake. Roll a d4; the result is how many lava bombs are hurled from the area, as if you had cast _lava bombs_. Each lava bomb lands in a point you choose within 60 feet of the lava lake.

    You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use a standard action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away.

    While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

    You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

    When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

While its eyes are averted, it can't see you or anything behind you. It can keep its eyes averted indefinitely, but it must immediately make the saving throw if it looks at you later.

    **Asleep.** The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses a standard action to shake the sleeper awake.

    **Panicked.** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

    The disguises created by this spell are based on how the other creature appears, including any illusory changes. Thus, if you cast _disguise self_ to look like an orc and then cast _face swap_ on an elf, you will look like the elf and the elf will look like an orc.

    You create an illusory window in a flat plane within range. The window must fit in ten contiguous 10-by-10 foot squares.

    The appearance of the window and what lies beyond it are up to you, chosen when you cast the spell. The illusion is only visible from one direction, can only include visual and auditory aspects, can't emit or block light, and can't block noise. For example, you could make a doorway leading to a nonexistent room, a magma-filled crevasse in the floor, or the image of an empty room that you can hide behind. 

    A creature can use the Study action to inspect the illusion, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the illusion is fake.

    If you cast this spell on the same spot with the same appearance every day for 30 days, the effect lasts until dispelled and doesn't require concentration.

    You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

    Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

    When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a standard action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a standard action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

    While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a standard action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

    You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

    Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the spell fails.

    The walls of the ravine are rough and can be climbed without an ability check.

    The ravine does not close when the spell ends unless you use a major action to do so. Each creature in the ravine when you close it can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d12 bludgeoning damage and is crushed between the walls. On a success, the creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed and potentially escape; otherwise, it takes half damage and is still crushed.

    You make an image of an object or disguise in your space that lasts until the start of your next turn. The image can't be longer than half your height in any dimension. You control the image's motion, which must remain in your space at all times. You can interact with the image as if it were a real item. For example, you could make a sword in your hand, put a halo behind your head, or give yourself pointy ears.

    A creature can use the Study action to inspect you from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers which aspects of your appearance are illusory.

    This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.

    The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. If can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

    If you move more than 100 feet away from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

    You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the _plane shift_ spell.

    In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).

    When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

    The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another _forbiddance_ spell. If you cast _forbiddance_ every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

    A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

    If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use a standard action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.

    You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

    You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

    The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

    Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

    When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

    You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

    You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

    You can end the spell early by using a standard action to dismiss it. A _remove curse_ or _greater restoration_ spell also ends it.

    Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

    A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use a standard action to dismiss the effect on it.

glyph_of_warding:
  casting_time: 1 hour
  components: V, S, M
  concentration: false
  description: |-
    When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that potentially harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

    The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Investigation check against your spell save DC to find it.

    You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

    You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

    When you inscribe the glyph, choose _explosive runes_ or a _spell glyph_.

    **Explosive Runes.** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **Spell Glyph.** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
  duration: Until dispelled
  higher_level: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an _explosive runes_ glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a _spell glyph,_ you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the _glyph of warding_.

On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability score.

    This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability score. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).

An affected creature can't regain hit points while in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it loses all of its temporary hit points.

    You cause the ground to shift beneath your enemies' feet. Up to three 5-foot wide, 1-inch tall square platforms rise from the ground at points you can see within range. Each platform then moves up to 30 feet along a straight line before sinking back into the ground. A platform safely lifts and carries any object or creature supported by the platform when it appeared, unless the target succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw to jump off.

    When a platform enters a creature or object's space, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the target can safely jump onto the platform or out of the way (its choice). Otherwise, the target is knocked prone, and if there is space on the platform for it to fit without squeezing, it is carried along with the platform.

  description: |-
    You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

    When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

    _Guards and wards_ creates the following effects within the warded area.

    **Corridors.** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

    **Doors.** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an _arcane lock_ spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the _minor illusion_ spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

    **Stairs.** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the _web_ spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.

    **Other Spell Effect.** You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.

    - Place _dancing lights_ in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as _guards and wards_ lasts.
    - Place _magic mouth_ in two locations.
    - Place _stinking cloud_ in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while _guards and wards_ lasts.
    - Place a constant _gust of wind_ in one corridor or room.
    - Place a _suggestion_ in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.

    The whole warded area radiates magic. A _dispel magic_ cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

    You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

    Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

    You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a _hallow_ spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.

    First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.

    Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

    **Courage.** Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area.

    **Darkness.** Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area.

    **Daylight.** Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can't extinguish the light.

    **Energy Protection.** Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

    **Energy Vulnerability.** Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

    **Everlasting Rest.** Dead bodies interred in the area can't be turned into undead.

    **Extradimensional Interference.** Affected creatures can't move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.

    **Fear.** Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

    **Silence.** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.

    **Tongues.** Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don't share a common language.

Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.

    The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature can use the Study action to inspect the terrain, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the terrain is illusory. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

  description: |-
    You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

    The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.

    When you cast the spell and as a minor action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

    **Clenched Fist.** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

    **Forceful Hand.** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability score. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.

    **Grasping Hand.** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a minor action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability score.

    **Interposing Hand.** The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

    You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 3d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

    As a minor action, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute (save ends). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

    If you lose concentration on the spell before its full duration passes, the burst of radiance happens as above, but it targets all creatures within 30 feet of the weapon (including you).

    You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors. A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded.

    The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 cold damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage as milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against it.

  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V, S

  description: |-
    By inverting the usual techniques of illusion magic, you can turn reality to illusion. Choose one creature or unattended object within range. If the target is a creature, it can make a Charisma saving throw to resist this spell's effect.

    The target becomes illusory for the duration. It remains visually and audibly unchanged. This spell gives you no special control over the creature's appearance or behavior. The creature counts as an illusion, not a creature, and thus can't be targeted by spells such as _mind sliver_.

    The target can still take actions, although anything it does is also illusory and has no effect on the real world. It can't do anything as an illusion that it couldn't do in reality. For example, it can't fly or walk through walls unless it has a means to do so.

    The target can use a standard action to make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on it. If the spell is dispelled, such as by _dispel magic_ or _disillusion_, the target safely returns to corporeality.

    Physical interaction with the target reveals it to be illusory, because things can pass through it. A creature can also use the Study action to inspect the target from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the image is illusory.

    You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.

    To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

    Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

    A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.

imprisonment:
  casting_time: 1 minute
  components: V, S, M
  concentration: false
  description: |-
    You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.

    When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

    **Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

    The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.

    **Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.

    The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.

    **Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.

    The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

    **Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

    The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

    **Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.

    The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

    **Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

    A _dispel magic_ spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

    You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

    When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

    A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

    Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

    The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use a standard action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

    A _disintegrate_ spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

    You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and doesn't move.

    The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

    Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this spell.

    A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As a standard action, a dancing creature makes a Charisma saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.

    Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.

    The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word _Rudnogg_ on the lips."

    The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use a standard action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

  description: |-
    Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container as a standard action, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid's body.

    You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a _protection from evil and good_ or _magic circle_ spell can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

    Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.

    Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't take actions at all.

    While possessing a body, you can use a standard action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

    If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

    When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

    You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

    When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

    The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

  description: |-
    You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).

    As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use a standard action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

    Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature can also use the Study action to inspect the image from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the image is illusory. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes translucent and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  duration: Up to 10 minutes
  higher_level: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

    Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

    You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.

    If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

    You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

    While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.

    Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

    A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.

    The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.

    A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.

    A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the _unseen servant_ spell.

    The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion. After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.

    Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

    You touch a Tiny object and imbue it with one of the following magical properties of your choice:
    - The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
    - Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
    - The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
    - A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

    The imbued effect lasts indefinitely, or until you use a standard action to touch and end it. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its effects active at a time. If there are already three effects active when you cast this spell, you choose one of those effects and end it before the new effect is imbued.

    You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as a standard action or cast this spell again.

    If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

    If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

    A creature can use the Study action to inspect the sound or image, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the sound or image is illusory. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes translucent (if visible) or faint (if auditory) to that creature.

    You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

    Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

    The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.

    Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

    Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use a standard Magic action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

    Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d12. If all three of your duplicates remain and you roll a 4 or higher, the attack instead targets one of your duplicates. You must roll a 5 or higher if two duplicates remain, or 7 or higher if one remains.

    A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity score. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

    A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

    You open a portal in range that lasts for the duration. The entrance is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall, but otherwise its appearance is up to you. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can pass through the portal as long as it remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.

    Beyond the portal is an extradimensional dwelling suited to your needs. When you cast the spell, you determine the interior atmosphere and layout. You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The dwelling can have the following contents:

    - Sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people.
    - A staff of up to 100 translucent servants. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the space but can't leave it.
    - Any furnishings and other objects you like.

    Anything created by this spell dissipates into smoke if removed from the space. When the entrance portal disappears, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

    If you cast this spell while a portal still remains from a previous casting of yours, you create another portal to the existing mansion, adjusting the floor plan minimally to accomodate the new entrance. As long as at least one entrance remains, creatures can stay in the space.

  description: |-
    You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

    While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

    You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

    A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

    You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

    - If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
    - You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
    - If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain.

    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as a standard action.

    A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

    When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

    On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use a standard action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

    You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.

    A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

    If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

    If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

phantasmal_force:
  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V, S, M
  concentration: true
  description: |-
    You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

    The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

    The target can use the Study action to inspect the phantasm, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

    While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

    An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

    The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

    At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting attack modifier. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

    For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use a standard action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

phantom_warriors:

  concentration: true
  description: |-
    Up to four illusory, Medium- or Small-sized phantom warriors appear in unoccupied spaces within range. Each creature's appearance and behavior is up to you. They appear real, visually and audibly, but are incorporeal.

    You can use a minor action to control the phantom warriors. Each warrior moves up to 40 feet to a point you can see and can pantomime an attack, though it can do no damage and appears to miss its target. You can also cause one of them to take the Taunt, Frighten, or Help (aid your or an ally's attack only) action, using your own ability scores and skill proficiencies for any ability checks.

    A creature can use the Study action to inspect a phantom warrior, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the warriors are illusory. A creature that knows the warriors are illusory can still be taunted, frightened, and affected by the Help action.

    You determine how a phantom warrior responds to effects that you are aware of. For example, if you see an enemy archer shoot a phantom warrior, you can cause the warrior appear to dodge out of the way. If you fail to do so, each creature that can see the warrior immediately learns that it is illusory. Additionally, a creature that targets a phantom warrior with a melee attack automatically gains the benefit of the Study action against it as if it had rolled an Investigation check with a result equal to the attack roll, potentially discerning its nature even if the warrior appeared to evade the attack.

    With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted _magic circle_ in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

    A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
  duration: 24 hours

If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.

    Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

    You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

    This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

    - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
    - You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
    - You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
    - You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
    - You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
    - You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as a standard action.

    Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

    **1. Red.** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **2. Orange.** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **3. Yellow.** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **4. Green.** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **5. Blue.** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

    **7. Violet.** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Charisma saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

    **8. Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

    You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as a standard action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

  description: |-
    You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

    When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

    The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

    Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature can also use the Study action to inspect the image from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the image is illusory. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

    You can use a standard action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

    You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a minor action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

    The cloud created by the blast lingers in the spell’s area for 1 minute after you cast this spell, or until dispersed by a strong wind. The cloud is heavily obscured, and its heat and poisonous gases make breathing difficult. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target is also poisoned unless it holds its breath.

    You turn the ground within 10 feet of a point you can see within range into treacherous quicksand. The area becomes difficult terrain, requiring 4 feet of movement spent for every 1 foot traveled.

    A creature that ends its turn on the sand must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target sinks halfway into the ground. A half-sunken target is slowed, has half cover from all sources, can't fly, and is immune to forced movement.

    At the end of a half-sunken creature's turn, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or sink further down, becoming mostly-sunken. In addition to the above effects, a mostly-sunken target is restrained and has three-quarters cover from all sources.

    At the end of a mostly-sunken creature's turn, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become fully-sunken. In addition to the above effects, a fully-sunken target is suffocating and has total cover from all sources.

    A sunken target immediately stops sinking if it leaves the area, and any time it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against the spell, its sunkenness decreases by one stage, potentially freeing itself. Additionally, a sunken target or nearby creature can use a standard action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to attempt to pull the target out. On a success, the target's sunkenness decreases by one stage.

    You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

    This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life.

    This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

    Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

    You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

    This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

    This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

    This spell is extremely taxing for both you and the target. The target returns to life with 1 level of exhaustion for each year it was dead (to a maximum 9 levels), and you gain the same number of levels of exhaustion.

All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

    If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

    You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use a standard action to dismiss it.

    When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

    - Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
    - The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
    - Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
    - Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.
    - Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
    - Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

    Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.
  duration: 24 hours
  higher_level: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

    You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you.

    On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

    On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

    Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

seeming:

  description: |-
    This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

    The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use a standard action to dismiss it sooner.

    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

    A creature can also use the Study action to inspect a target from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers which aspects of the target's appearance are illusory.

    By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.

    If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.

    You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

    You attempt to pry a creature's soul from its body. One creature you can see within range takes 10d4 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw.

In this state, the target experiences all the effects of the unconscious condition (though this does not count as being unconscious). The target also has immunity to psychic damage and any effect that can't target an object, as the target's mind is physically elsewhere.

    If the _revivify_ spell is cast on the target, its material components are not consumed and this spell ends.

    If you maintain concentration on this spell for the full duration and you are within 5 feet of the target when it ends, you can slash out with the dagger used as the spell's material component and sever the target's soul. This kills the target.

  description: |-
    You are transformed into different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

    When you transform in this way, you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours.

    You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.

    When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.

    During this spell's duration, you can use a standard action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

    You can use a standard action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

    Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature can also use the Study action to inspect the image from a distance, making an Investigation check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature discovers that the image is illusory. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

simulacrum:

  components: V, S, M

  description: |-
    You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from the material components of the spell, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.

    The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.

    If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

    If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.
  duration: Until dispelled

    This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

    Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses a standard action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

    The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.

    If an affected creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of an action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must repeat the Magic action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

  description: |-
    This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.

    **Steal Life.** You can use a minor action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

    **Query Soul.** You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

    **Borrow Experience.** You can use a minor action to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

    **Eyes of the Dead.** You can use a standard action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

    A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using _see invisibility_ or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

    You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.

    Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

    You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

    Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

    If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

    This spell can cause the plants created by the _entangle_ spell to release a restrained creature.

    Each target in the path of the pillar must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pushed along with the pillar and any other targets in the way. A creature can willingly fail this save. Due to the speed of the pillar's growth, you can cause each target that failed its save to be pushed up to 10 feet beyond where the pillar stops.

    The pillar's growth is stopped by an immovable obstacle or a Huge or larger target. The blocking obstacle and each target pushed by the pillar takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the original surface was difficult terrain. Whether or not it reached its full length, the pillar retracts immediately after its growth stops.
  duration: Instantaneous
  higher_level: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can create one additional pillar within range for each slot level above 1st.

  casting_time: 1 major action
  components: V, S
  concentration: true
  description: |-
    A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 1 mile, affecting the space down to 1 mile below the cloud. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and strong winds roar.

    The clouds obstruct the sun, reducing the natural light levels to dim light. Powerful winds blow in the area, making flight impossible, dispersing gases and other clouds, and causing ranged attacks to automatically miss. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

    When you cast the spell and as a major action on each of your turns for the duration of the spell, you can cause one of the following effects:

    **Torrential Rain.** A deluge of water pours from the sky. Any open fires in the area are extinguished, the ground becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and any holes less than 10 feet deep are filled with water. The area is heavily obscured by the driving rain until the start of your next turn.

    **Crashing Lightning.** Tremendous bolts of lightning strike up to six points beneath the cloud of your choice that you can see. Each creature or object within 5 feet of one or more points must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, each creature within 100 feet of one or more points must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage and become deafened for 5 minutes.

    **Pounding Hail.** Massive hailstones fall from the clouds. Until the start of your next turn, each creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters it for the first time on a turn takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and the ground becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.

    **Gale Winds.** Howling winds blow through the area in a direction of your choice. Until the start of your next turn, every foot traveled against the wind costs an additional 3 feet of movement, and movement downwind is quadrupled. Additionally, each creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be blown 30 feet downwind and knocked prone.

    A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.

    Until the spell ends, you can use a minor action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.

    Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.

    You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.

    The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

    You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

    If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

    When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

    The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Investigation check against your spell save DC to find it.

    You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.

    You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

    When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

    **Death.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

    **Discord.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

    **Fear.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

    **Hopelessness.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.

    **Insanity.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.

    **Pain.** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.

    **Sleep.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses a standard action to shake or slap it awake.

    **Stunning.** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

    You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as a standard action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

    **Creature.** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

    On subsequent rounds, you can use a standard action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

    **Object.** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

    If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

    You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

    This spell teleports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

    The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.

    | Familiarity       | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
    | :---------------- | :----: | :----------: | :--------: | :-------: |
    | Permanent circle  |   —    |      —       |     —      |  01-100   |

    | Seen casually     | 01-33  |    34-43     |   44-53    |  54-100   |
    | Viewed once       | 01-43  |    44-53     |   54-73    |  74-100   |
    | Description       | 01-43  |    44-53     |   54-73    |  74-100   |
    | False destination | 01-50  |    51-100    |     —      |     —     |

    **Familiarity.** "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.

    "Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.

    "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

    **On Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.

    **Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.

    **Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

    **Mishap.** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

    As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly teleports to the destination circle or to the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

    Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

    You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

  description: |-
    You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.

    You make all decisions about the temples appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.

    The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.

    The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.

    In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.

    Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your spellcasting ability score (minimum 1 hit point).

    The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temples interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by _dispel magic_, and _antimagic field_ has no effect on it. A _disintegrate_ spell destroys the temple instantly.

    Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

    Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

    At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

    Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.

    This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

    Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

    You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the Tiny Servant stat block for its statistics.

    As a minor action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what actions the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

    When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

  description: |-
    You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube and is within range, and choose one of the following effects.

    **Transmute Rock to Mud.** Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.

    The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use a standard action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.

    If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    **Transmute Mud to Rock.** Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use a standard action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

    A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.

    When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

    At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

    A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.

    The skull scepter used as the spell's material component becomes magical for the duration and can be used to command the undead. As a standard action, any creature wielding the scepter can magically command any number of undead created by this casting of the spell within range. The command must be straightforward and 10 words or less, such as "kill the dragon in the mountain" or "bring me the pearl necklace." If you issue a command to an undead that already has a command, the undead forgets its previous command and begins carrying out the new one.

    The undead interpret commands literally and may act contrary to their intent. For example, if you issued the command "find the pearl necklace," your minions may uselessly gather at the bottom of the river where the necklace lies.

    This spell can only be cast at night. If the skull scepter is dispelled or used to cast this spell again, any preexisting undead crumble to dust.

  description: |-
    You alter reality on a massive scale. This spell creates a 1,000-foot-radius sphere centered on you and remaining fixed in place for the duration. If you leave the area, the spell ends.

    When you cast the spell, and as a major action on subsequent turns, you can reshape the appearance of reality within the sphere in each the following ways:
    - All illusions and illusion spells in the area are suppressed, except for those you choose not to suppress.
    - You can create illusory terrain, objects, and environmental details, but not creatures. The illusions can include visual, audible, and even olfactory elements. For example, you could make a burning forest with the smell of smoke in the air, but not a dragon flying through the sky.
    - You can cause real terrain, unattended objects, and environmental details to become invisible, inaudible, and unsmellable.
    - You can change the perceived temperature, but not enough to cause or prevent damage.
    - You can change the light and to what degree the area is obscured.
    - From within the sphere, you can cause the outside to appear however you wish, and vice versa. For example, you could make a small town disappear to the outside world, while the town inhabitants experience a solar eclipse.

    These changes last until the spell ends or until you change them again. You can be as specific or as general as you want when making these changes; the spell automatically fills in missing details to match your proscribed reality.

    If the spheres of two or more castings of _unreality_ would overlap, each point in space is controlled by the sphere whose center is closest to that point.

    As a standard action, you or another creature you permit can create a damaging effect. The effect can deal any damage type of your choice. It can be inflicted with a melee spell attack for 8d10 damage, a ranged spell attack with infinite range for 6d10 damage, or a saving throw of your choice targeting up to 10 creatures for 4d10 damage (dealing half damage on a successful save). The nature of the effect is up to you, but the damage must be dealt before the start of your next turn. For example, you could let an archer shoot a beam of light, or force the next 10 creatures that get too close to lava to make a saving throw against fire damage. Once this standard action is used, it can't be used again until the start of your next turn.

    Once on each of your turns as a minor action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wind. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

    If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

    A nonmagical wall of compact dirt rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. The wall is 3 inches thick and up to 20 feet long.

    If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall

    The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each 5-foot long section has AC 8, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it, leaving behind a 5-foot square of difficult terrain that takes at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

    You create a wall of living flesh within range. The wall is 1 foot thick, up to 10 feet tall, and up to 40 feet long in a straight line. It must be supported underneath by a solid surface at all times. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side).

    The wall is an object with 10 AC and immunity to psychic damage and forced movement. It starts with 2 hit points for every foot of its length, regardless of its height. The wall has no hit point maximum. Whenever it gains or loses hit points, the wall must grow or shrink so that its length in feet is equal to half its current hit points. You determine the amount by which it grows (or shrinks) in each direction, potentially pushing creatures lengthwise according to the rules in the next paragraph. The wall can't gain hit points if there isn't space for it to grow.

    At the start of each of your turns, the wall regenerates 20 hit points. As a minor action, you can cause the wall to move up to 5 feet in a direction of your choice, automatically pushing Large or smaller creatures along with it. A Huge or larger creature in the wall's way can make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, preventing the wall's movement on a success; otherwise, it is also pushed.

    The wall has eyes and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. When a creature the wall can see starts its turn within 5 feet of the wall, the wall attacks it with fleshy tendrils. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled by the wall (escape DC equals your spell save DC).
  duration: Up to 1 minute

It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

    Nothing can physically pass through the wall. The wall even extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. It can't be dispelled by _dispel magic_, but a _disintegrate_ spell destroys the wall instantly.

    The wall can also be attacked. It has 100 hit points and 20 AC. If the wall is destroyed by reducing it to 0 hit points, it creates a brief planar convergence. Each creature within 5 feet of the wall must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 4d10 force damage. A target that fails the save by 10 or more is transported to the Ethereal Plane if it was on the plane the spell was cast in or vice versa.

You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

    If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

    The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  duration: Up to 10 minutes
  higher_level: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

  description: |-
    A shimmering wall of bright light appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet.

    When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute (save ends). On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

    A creature that ends its turn in the wall's area takes 4d8 radiant damage.

    Until the spell ends, you can use a standard action to launch a beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 10 feet. If the walls length drops to 0 feet, the spell ends.
  duration: Up to 10 minutes

wall_of_stone:
  casting_time: 1 standard action
  components: V, S, M
  concentration: true
  description: |-
    A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

    If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

    The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

    If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

    The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.

    If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.
  duration: Up to 10 minutes
  higher_level: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create two additional panels for each slot level above 5th.

    You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

    When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

    A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.

    Any ranged weapon attack that enters the walls space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the walls water doesn't fill it.

  description: |-
    You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.

    Any creature in the spheres space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water (save ends).

    The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.

    As a standard action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.

    When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

    You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and cause the area to be lightly obscured.

    If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

    Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

    A creature restrained by the webs can use a standard action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

    The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

    A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use a standard action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

    A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

    A restrained creature can use a standard action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

    The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss.
